  <li>KuroKami: <a href="https://github.com/AmashiSenpai/HolocureMods/blob/main/kurokami.win">kurokami.win</a> this changes the tail color of fubuki to match the kurokami outfit</li>
</ul>


# Setup
<ol>
  <li>Download the mod you want.</li>
  <li>locate where the folder containing holocure launcher is saved on your computer. <br /> for me this is located in <code>C:/Program Files/Holocure/</code></li>
  <li>if you're in the right place you'll see anouther folder named <code>HoloCure</code> we'll need to open this folder and change it a bit.</li>
  <li>in order to make it so you can use the modded version we have to rename the <code>data.win</code> file to something else that ends in <code>.win</code> (i renamed mine "actual.win" but you can name it whatever)</li>
  <li>next we'll add the mod we downloaded to this folder</li>
  <li>once the mod is in the same folder as our original data.win file we can run the game</li>
  <li>whenever you update the game it'll download a new data.win file meaning you'll have to repeat some of these steps</li>
  <li>when you run the game it'll bring up a file manager to select which <code>.win</code> file we want to use. locate your mod file and open it.</li>
  <li>from there your mod should work. enjoy!</li>
</ol>
